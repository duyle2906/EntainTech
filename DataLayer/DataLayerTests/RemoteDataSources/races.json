He's got the ratings necessary to take this out and if Gaudray can slot him in behind the speed he should go close. NATION'S CALL (1) is a handy horse with a good record, coming off an easy win at very short odds at Pakenham over a subsequent winner. Rates highly and will take beating. STAR VEGA (3) was okay first up in a bunched finish when unable to threaten but will be much fitter and the rise in trip suits. RUN NAAN (6) has won his past two and must have a case. OVERACTIVE (4) was okay at his Australian debut and can improve.",

ALMA ROXANE (2) faded last time to finish sixth over 1600m at this track after showing good early speed. Change of rider to Tatsuya Watanabe who has an excellent strike rate when in the saddle, including two wins. Sure to play a big role. CAP CORSE (5) ran a better race and finished fourth last time out over 1400m at this circuit. Nicely placed to feature in the finish. PATRIE (4) did well last start but found a couple better over 1400m here. Finds a suitable race and can build on that solid recent effort.",
