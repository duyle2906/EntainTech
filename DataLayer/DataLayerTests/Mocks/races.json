He looks to have gone to a new level this time in and Chris Parnham taking the ride is a positive sign. Can build on what he did first-up. HARBIN (1) just missed when running on strongly from the back over 1200m a fortnight ago. Out in trip and the added fitness are both ticks, though he will need some luck from a wide draw once again.

Ideally placed and is sure to prove tough to beat again. ISE BAY (1) showed good pace and went on to score by 1.5 lengths last time out here. Should enjoy a good run just off the speed. Taking on a better line-up this time but he cannot be underestimated. KAWAKITA MAX (2) is experiencing a long win drought, extended last start when eighth after being in contention on the bend. Well placed and there is no reason she cannot return to winning ways. BELLAGIO UMAMUSUKO (6) showed good early speed and raced on the pace last start before fading to finish fourth. Worth including.",
